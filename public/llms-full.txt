## Privacy Policy Overview
# PrivacyPolicy

I am transparent about the data I collect and how it is used.

Last updated: 2025-02-06

This website is completely open-source, you can read the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/arpitdalal/arpitdalal.dev).

## 1\. Introduction

This Privacy Policy explains how Arpit Dalal (‚Äúme‚Äù, ‚ÄúI‚Äù, or ‚Äúmy‚Äù) handles information related to my website, arpitdalal.dev (the ‚ÄúSite‚Äù). By using the Site, you consent to the practices described herein. Importantly, the Site does not store any personal information on its own servers.

## 2\. Information Collection and Storage

I collect non-personal information automatically when you visit the Site. This information may include:

### Contact Form:

When you use the contact form, the information you provide (such as your name, email address, and message) is transmitted directly to my designated email address (or another processing mechanism) and is not stored on the Site.

### Newsletter Signup:

When you subscribe to my newsletter, your email address is forwarded directly to my third-party service (Hashnode) for the purpose of managing my blog and newsletter. This information is not stored on the Site itself. You can visit the [Hashnode Privacy Policy](https://hashnode.com/privacy) to learn more about how Hashnode handles your data.

### Analytics:

I use PostHog and Umami for website analytics. These services collect non-personally identifying data to help me analyze and improve the Site. The data collected by PostHog is not stored by me on my servers. I self-host Umami so I do store data on my servers. Both services are privacy-focused and collect only anonymous data.Umami enables me to make analytics data publicly accessible. You can review [all the data it collects](https://stats.arpitdalal.dev/share/OzZPGxjmA4C1nlzZ/arpitdalal.dev).

### 3\. How I Use Your Information

Since the Site does not store any user-submitted information, I do not maintain or process personal data on my own servers. Third-party systems manage the respective data flows:

- Contact Form: Data is used solely to forward your inquiry to my email; no storage occurs.
- Newsletter Subscription: Data is used to manage and send you my newsletter; Hashnode stores this data.
- Analytics: Data is used to understand visitor trends and improve the Site's performance; PostHog and Umami store this data in an anonymous format.

### 4\. Third-Party Services

I do not sell or share your personal information. Any personal data that may be processed (e.g., your email address when subscribing to my newsletter) is handled by third-party service providers, such as Hashnode for email management and PostHog for analytics. Please review their privacy policies for more details on their practices.

### 5\. Data Security

While the Site itself does not store personal information, any data transmitted via our forms is sent through secure channels (e.g., HTTPS). I take reasonable technical measures to ensure that transmissions are secure; however, no method of transmission over the Internet is completely secure.

### 6\. Data Retention

Because the Site does not store personal data, I do not maintain records of user submissions. Data provided via forms is used in real-time (e.g., sent directly to an email) and is not retained on our Site.

### 7\. Your Rights

Under Canadian privacy law (such as PIPEDA), you have the right to inquire about or request changes to any personal data held by third-party service providers. Since the Site itself does not store your data, any such requests should be directed to the appropriate third party. For questions, please contact me using the information below.

### 8\. Cookies and Tracking Technologies

My Site uses cookies and similar technologies to facilitate its operation and analytics. Cookies help in understanding visitor behavior; however, they do not identify you personally. You may adjust your browser settings to refuse cookies, but this might affect your ability to use certain features of the Site such as using system theme.

### 9\. Changes to This Privacy Policy

I may update this Privacy Policy periodically to reflect changes in my practices or applicable law. The updated policy will be posted on this page with a new ‚ÄúLast Updated‚Äù date. I encourage you to review this policy periodically.
